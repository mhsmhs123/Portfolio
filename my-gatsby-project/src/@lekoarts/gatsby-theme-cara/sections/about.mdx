## About

#### I'm a 20 year old university student from Toronto. 

Currently, I'm pursuing a major in Applied Statistics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Toronto. In my free time I enjoy reading, watching TV series and movies, and playing chess. You can check out my personal blog [here](https://muz-s.medium.com/)
